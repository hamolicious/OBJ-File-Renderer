# OBJ-File-Renderer
Renders OBJ file formats to a 2D display, uses Python and Pygame

This is a rough 'sketch up' of the little side project, I will be cleaning up the UI and optimising the code a lot too later on!

To use this script use the following commands:
```
pip install pygame

git clone https://github.com/hamolicious/OBJ-File-Renderer
cd /OBJ-File-Renderer
python main.py 'PATH_TO_OBJ_FILE'
```

If you do not want to install any packages, you can also use repl.it to run PyGame scripts!

Please create issues to tell me what you like/don't like about this project.
If I missed anything please create an issue too!
